# Transportation-Modes-Stuctured-Prediction

## @ By Hasan PourmahmoodAghababa on March 27, 2021

### This is the repository for my "Geolife Transportation Modes" project in Structured Prediction course at University of Utah taken in Spring 2021.

I'm using the "Geolife trajectory dataset", released by Microsoft in 2012, to predict the transportation mode of a given trajectory. The methods I will try to apply are some supervised techniques from structured prediction course, like HMM, CMM, CRF, structured SVM, etc. In fact, I have to decide which model is appropriate for a trajectory dataset. 

Next, as I have seen some papers trying to predict transportation modes of this interesting data as a mutli-class classification, I am interested to do a same task but employing another technique taken from my joint paper with Jeff Phillips 

"J. M. Phllips and H. Pourmahmood-Aghababa, Orientation-Preserving Vectorized Distance Be- tween Curves, Submitted"

as well as an idea from the following paper by Jeff Phillips and Tang

"Jeff M. Phillips and Pingfan Tang. Simple distances for trajectories via landmarks. In ACM GIS SIGSPATIAL, 2019".

The best one has got 76% accuracy,
